Must have:

1. Add support for materials (metal, plastic demos)
2. Use a rendering queue for multi processing
   a. Front end - visible surface determination
   b. Back end - render based on a render command and context/view
   c. Occlusion queries and clipping on GPU
3. Deferred rendering
4. Entity system (component or no?)
5. Event system
6. Scripting support (Either C or some lisp/scheme language)
7. Retained mode GUI
8. Particles engine
9. Model viewer for prototyping assets
10. Data driven design
11. Terrain rendering
12. File system (compression)

Nice to have:
1. Physics engine
2. Level editor
3. Material editor
4. Particle editor
5. An actual game
